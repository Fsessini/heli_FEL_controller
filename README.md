# Adaptive controller of helicopter attitude
Project for the course of Advanced Aircraft Guidance and Control. I chose to implement a Feedback Error Learning architecture enhanced with a RBF Neural Network, for the attitude control of a teetering helicopter. I developed a simplified 6 DoF model of a Bell AH-1 and the controller itself in MATLAB/Simulink.\
The file [parameters.m](/parameters.m) contains the specifics of the helicopter while the settings for the controller are inside [FEL_RBFNN.m](/FEL_RBFNN.m). The complete non-linear model is contained in [non_lin_dyn_model.slx](/non_lin_dyn_model.slx), while the analytical linearization of the attitude dynamics around the hover condition, which is used to derive the control law and also to test the efficacy of the neural network, is implemented inside [lin_att_model.slx](/lin_att_model.slx). The script [results.m](/results.m) performs an extensive test of the controller in terms of trajectory tracking and robustness against external disturbancies.\
See the [report pdf](/report.pdf) for a detailed explanation.
