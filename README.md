# Adaptive controller of helicopter attitude
Project for the course of Advanced Aircraft Guidance and Control. I chose to implement a Feedback Error Learning architecture enhanced with a RBF Neural Network, for the attitude control of a teetering helicopter. I implemented a simplified 6 DoF model of a Bell AH-1 and the controller in MATLAB/Simulink.
See the [report pdf](/report.pdf) for a detailed explanation.
